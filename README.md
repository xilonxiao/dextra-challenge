# Reactive Native challenge

## To build and run the app:

This app is built on top of [expo](https://expo.io/), so you don't need the
native SDKs to build it (even though it's also possible).

You'll only need `npm` [installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to handle de dependencies.

    npm install
    expo start
